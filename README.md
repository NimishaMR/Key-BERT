# Key-BERT
Welcome to the repository pertaining to my work on Keyword extraction from documents using semantic search , fuzzy logic and Sentence Transformers embedding models architecture using Key-BERT as the underlying architecture

This repo contains the code, dataset and the expected input output file
Since this was a done using a self trained model, the code is specific to the use case
 **Here's a little background on what Key-BERT is and how we made use of the Sentence Transformer Model
